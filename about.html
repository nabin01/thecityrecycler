            <p class="desp">The City Recycler is a web based virtual platform to make use of the old things that are left unused in our houses, such as old hardware, TV, radio, DVD players, furniture, kitchen appliances and many more. The basic objective of the product is to provide a marketplace for such items.</p>

            <p class="desp">Instead of being thrown away and left at dust, those things can be used to make money or exchanged with some other items that are useful. The City Recycler provides people with platform to decide what to do with such items.</p>
